The grate is 21 1/2 inches in diameter and is designed for use in 22 1/2 inch-diameter Weber kettle grills. The grate is manufactured out of sturdy, thick-gauge steel. The quality of the construction is evident; the grate is made in Taiwan. If you have owned cooking grates in the past that were made out of thin-gauged, flimsy steel which sagged under the weight of heavy foods such as brisket or large steaks, rest assured, sagging simply won't happen with this grate -- the thick-gauge steel bars and the circular insert in the middle of the grate allow for increased structural support as compared with the steel bars of flimsier grates.    The feature which increases the utility of this grate as compared with standard cooking grates are the  two hinged sections on the left and right sides of the grate, which allow the grate to flip upwards so that one can add additional charcoal or smoking chips/chunks, as needed. In addition, the center of the grate features a circular section approximately 12 inches in diameter, which is entirely removable, and, which can be removed to add charcoal and/or smoking woods, or, replaced with one of Weber's modular replacement sections, such as a griddle or a cast iron searing plate. Cleaning the grate is as easy as using hot water, dish soap and a steel wool scouring pad to scrape away fats and grease. The steel will acquire a patina over time from smoke and oil, but, that is to be expected, and, it doesn't affect performance in any way. This is a quality product which will last a long time.\",\n",

The top one is rated at 2.4A/5V and is designed for charging tablets and larger devices while the bottom one is rated at 1.5A/5V and is designed for charging smartphones and smaller devices.<br /><br />There is a blue indicator light that lets you know when the charger is plugged in correctly and pulling power. This is nice because sometimes I don't push my chargers in all the way, plus they are easy to see in the dark. Overall, its an excellent charger. This charger only includes the charger, there are no extra cables included. There is also a 24 month warranty that comes with this purchase so you know you are covered if you have any problems.\",\n",

Which was the opening day.... for the past couple days i have unsuccessfully not connected to the servers. So i paid $80 for a demo. (i got the digital deluxe edition.) Of what i DID play its awesome....accept that you have to play with other players, NOT TRUE....you can make a private game. Or INVITE ONLY game. The problem with the online server is that only ONE of the dam areas that you can build your city works and you can only build your city on one plot of land. As far as game looks and gameplay, it's excellent. I liked how easy the menus were and its close to the other simcity gameplay. A lot of new things to go along with it too. I HATE that it does not have offline mode, i a member of the armed forces and what i do in my offtime is workout and game, and i love this game and i really dislike that i cannot play it while out to sea or deployed to places that don't have internet. (which is in May) As you all know the servers are not working...So what do you get when you have an Online game that runs on online servers that dont work? a game that doesn't work, and ultimately thats how this review is going to go for this. I paid $80 for 3 hours of working gameplay. Thank you EA and Maxim for delivering so far.. I will update and rate based on the game working....when it is actually working...but until then...1 star.\",\n",

The pictures inside are superb and although I have not read all of the stories inside, the first few I've read give background to the photographs that make them more real and meaningful.

A stand-alone easy dinner treat.<br /><br />One winter evening my wife and I went out for dinner and decided to pay a visit to a Hard Times Chili parlor. Imagine my surprise when I opened the menu to find three different types of chili. I'm thinking &#34;really, how different can chili recipes be?&#34; I decided to ask our waitress about the differences and she told me about Cincinnati style. The difference being the cinnamon added to the batch.<br /><br />I was so pleased that I tried this style - I LOVE cinnamon. It is one of my favorite spices. So, I dug in with some fresh cornbread and a cold beer and was so pleasantly surprised - I now had a new favorite chili recipe. The problem arose when we moved to a new location and there were no Hard Times cafes in our neighborhood. So I began the hunt for a Cincinnati style chili mix that was as good as Hard Times. After scouring Amazon for other reviews I decided to take a chance on this particular brand. It is SPOT ON to my experience at Hard Times and is a great price. We have made only a small change to the preparation instructions that are supplied with the packets - we cut the amount of water that they recommend adding to the mix by almost half and now have the same taste and consistency that we loved at Hard Times.\",\n",

There's no way to clean it up enough to get rid of the odor. I had to throw out everything that was contaminated. I couldn't get past the odor enough to put coated krill oil capsules and coated medications in my mouth. Please keep in mind, though, that this only happened maybe 4 or 5 times. I've consumed maybe 120 capsules so far.

The wig comes in a solid, hard box with netting; great for re-storage. It's thick enough and definitely does not have bald spots. The top curls are well secured with some kind of bobby pins. The side curls held up very well after two months of handling (taking it out, putting on, repackaging). It has elastic straps inside for size adjustment.<br /><br />Things of Note: I tried it first with just my hair pinned up. It was a little loose and the next strap adjustment notch was too tight on me. Next I tried it with a cheap wig cap which really made the wig slide around. The cap got a run after the first usage and got tossed anyway. What I found worked great for me was a pair of control top panty hose with the legs cut off and tied to make a wig cap. The ribbing texture on the hose gave the wig something to grip to and it stayed on securely and comfortably, even through some light activity (tilting head back and a slight skirmish with other characters onstage). Recommend also using a few bobby pins for extra security. The last thing any actress wants is to lose her hair onstage.<br />The bangs are a little long and do have a tendency to get in one's eyes.

              " (\"Game is great... Amazon, not so much. Buyer beware that Amazon is misleading. I ordered 2 copies of this game for different people as Christmas presents. As a pre-order promotion Amazon was offering a game code that would unlock additional game content. After the order was shipped I received 2 games but only one game code. Not really paying much attention to it (my fault) I printed out the game code and attached it inside the wrapped presents not noticing that there was only one code (in spite of the fact I bought and paid for 2 games). Upon discovering this (after) the boys (2 nephews) had opened their Christmas presents I immediately felt like a heal because one game code can not be used twice; hence one gets the upgrade one does not. On Christmas day (after they boys had opened their gifts (together) the problem was immediately obvious. So, I contacted Amazon asking for help but was informed that only one code per customer could be issued no matter how many games you ordered. WTF? What kind of BS is that? Where is the logic? With this experience I want to share with everyone that if you need to order multiple copies of the same game expecting to receive the same pre-order benefits don't do it with Amazon. Order yours and have others order additional games for you if you are going to buy from Amazon; or just buy from someone else. After contacting Amazon I have been told I can send any unopened games back... Like that is even an option. Amazon customer relations and marketing needs an enema. Now I have 2 little boys disappointed on Christmas day because if I give to one I can't give to the other. This is certainly the last time I will buy games from Amazon without playing their stupid games. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.

US plugs fit in there nice and secure with plenty of space for even the humongous AC plugs (that in itself is a major attraction).<br /><br />This probably won't take any major abuse, such as knocking around a gnarly toolbox or nasty construction areas, yet for me more staid circumstances, giving me direct power for powering laptops/ and USB devices, this is does what exactly I have been wanting.

To me the 1st Gen Wave is where its at.  The small flathead was the PERFECT size and new one breaks very easily.  The new scissors also does not cut as well and sometimes jams up on the pliers when closing.  Leatherman needs to bring back the 1st Gen Wave.<br /><br />Anyhow, the Surge is beefier in the hand but still fits in a 9mm mag pouch (how I carry it on my MOLLE chest rig).  The only noticable difference other than the size is that the outer file has been replaced with a beefier scissors that actually cuts instead of bending material.  The inner flathead is wider, the soon-to-be-broken small flathead is still there, and there is a small scraping blade (at least that's what I think it might be).<br /><br />One of the things I miss most about my 1st Gen Wave is that with minimal break-in I could open it like a butterfly knife with one hand.

All said, I would highly recommend this tool over the 2nd Gen Wave (but not the 1st Gen Wave).<br /><br />UPDATE:  Upon removing the sheath from the packaging I noticed a small, thin plastic sheath containing a file blade that can be swapped out with the saw blade.

Lonely Planet really gets into a country in their guides. The don't fill their pages with glossy color photos, though a few would be nice, instead their pages are full of information.<br /><br />They have maps to everywhere you'd want to go in a country. They do the cities justice as well as the countryside. They do the markets and the beaches, the churches and the museums, the bike trails and the footpaths.<br /><br />I believe a trip to Thailand should include a side tour to Vietnam, at least mine is going to, so both books are a necessity to me. The book on Thailand is over 800 pages and its writers write as if they've lived there, as if they really know the country. A different group of writers have written the Vietnam book and that surprised me, because I though some of them would have worked on both books. Nevertheless, though it's 250 pages shorter than the Thailand book, the book on Vietnam is equally as well written.<br /><br />I should say that the print in these books is on the smallish side, but I suppose to make it any larger they'd have to have so many pagers that the books would be unwieldy, especially the Thailand book.<br /><br />I've always looked at Lonely Planet as catering to a different kind of clientele than Frommor's or Fodor's. Those two companies seem to cater more toward the traveler who has more to spend, who will more than likely stay in the more expensive hotels. Sure you'll find the expensive hotels in Lonely Planet as well, but you'll find a myriad of less expensive alternatives. I believe you get more information about a country from Lonely Planet and I'm looking forward to going to Thailand and Vietnam and having Lonely Planet show me the way.\",\n",

Pros you can hang the base on the wall within reach of your favorite source, be it your tv or stereo or whatever and in my case, I have a stereo in the basement and TV and receiver upstairs. The reason I mention this is because. I sometimes hook the set downstairs, put on some cd's or vinyl and sit on the porch and they sound fine (about 30 feet distance) When the wife goes to bed, I connect to the T.V upstairs and listen to the game (loud). It comes with 1/4 adaptor and it comes off leaving the 1/8 inch which fits most computers etc. It has an adjustment setting (3 way) on the base for best frequency and a dial on the headset to make it more clear. In some cases it takes a few minutes to get the settings right. Which brings the Con (or one of them) The volume control is directly above where you adjust the frequency settings so if you're not paying attention you can accidently adjust frequency when you want to turn the volume up. The only other con is (and it's only because it isn't in the manual) is this. If you adjust the headset (as in pull one side down to adjust for your head, You have to put both sides all the way back up before putting the headset on the base for charging. Now this should be obvious but I adjusted my headset and was jamming and dropped the headset. When I went to charge them it wouldn't sit straight on the stand and I thought I bent them by dropping them. I even started pulling the headset a little so it would sit even on the base. It wasn't until I started really looking at the headset on the base where I did the (duh) and walked over and pushed both earpieces up and set it back on the base. It was fine. These are really comfortable as well. These are definitely worth the price and I would buy again.

She gets a yellow drip from her eye and nose which causes a raw spot on her lip and bacteria problems on the skin of the whole side of her face and beard. She also has thick dead skin that just won't shed independently without this medicated skin thereapy. She HATES the taste of it (as did the pet in the previous review), which causes her to not be cooperative for the treatments. You HAVE to keep up with the treatments daily until the condition clears; if you don't follow the directions it obviously won't work. Be liberal with the coverage or dosing, and DO keep the animals away from water and sand or walnut bedding as it will stick to the syrup like treatment or wash off. It does not affect breeding animals as she had two clutches totalling 53 eggs during daily dreatments. Her's is a lifelong problem.<br />If it wasn't for this medication, I know a specialty veterinarian would have charged me $$$ to get my beardy Huevos back to health. Give this product a try for the recommended symptoms in the description - it is worth the money. It has a tip that is a drop dispenser making applications on small spots easy. Watch that your pet doesn't clamp down on the tip for mouth treatments because they can remove the hard dropper end and get it their mouth along with a glob of medine.

So any time you want to put numbers in your labels, you must toggle a modifier key first. Even worse, all of the punctuation is buried behind the format or insert menus. I'm sure at some point I could get used to where they are all hidden, but why? Similarly, all of the layout options (two line printing, italics, etc.) are also uncovered by working around in those menus. It takes several times more time to work out a label (anything more than simple alphabet characters) than it really should, and longer than it does with other label makers.    The worst part has been the labels themselves. The white paper (non-laminated) labels it comes with have yet to stick for an extended period (a few weeks). Every single one of them, no matter the surface placed on (wood, laminate, plastic, metal), has started to peel up. Due to the low price, I got some of the other label types and so far the laminated ones seem to actually stick. The peeling labels wouldn't be nearly so infuriating if it wasn't so dang difficult to re-print them (when they have any formatting).    This would probably be a good labeler for someone who wants to make simple labels like a name. If you want to make anything more complex, there are far better options that are far more user-friendly. And the labels, at least the ones I've used, do not have any staying power. I am so far very disappointed in the experience of typing a label and the longevity of the labels themselves.    ***UPDATE***     So after a few more weeks, I can say that I'm still not impressed. The glossy laminated labels seem to be adhering better, but they still don't stick as well as I was expecting. The paper labels are essentially useless. I've found that the less you handle the back, the better, but this is easier said than done. You have to touch the back at least a little to line things up.    The symbols available are fairly extensive, but it's a real pain in the ass to build a simple label with multiple symbols (including basic punctuation!) because you have to go back into the insert menu, go up and down the list of symbols until you find the one you want, and then can select it. Entering the same symbol over and over again is easy, the menu at least remembers where you are. For example, it took about a dozen key presses to find the ohm symbol. Not the end of the world, that's fairly specific. But then to add the dash (to indicate a range) took another eight or ten presses, then another eight or ten to get back to the ohm symbol. Seems way more hard than it needs to be, particularly for common punctuation (period, comma, et. al.).     Finally, the two line mode really, really stinks. It's difficult to select the line. There is no enter key to just make a new line, so you have to go into the menus, remembering if it's insert or format or settings. And then it prints out all squished. Single lines print out professional looking, but the two line look like the characters have been stretched about 30%. You cannot use the double and the single line labels together and expect an even remotely cohesive look.\",\n",

They complained of cheapness and odor (like chemical odors). I certainly didn't want something from China off-gassing in my house. Once of the reviews recommended a Cozy Sack instead, so I looked those up and found this item.<br /><br />I ordered a 4' navy bag and it arrived today. I thought the packaging was a bit small and that it might not be big enough, but after taking it out and letting the foam absorb some air, it might even be too big for my originally desired use. It was a bit of a struggle to get it out of the tight packaging without using a knife or blade, but I managed.<br /><br />And fortunately it doesn't stink of chemicals (unless you put your nose right up to it and take a big whiff)! If it did my wife would have had me remove it right away (she is very sensitive to that).<br /><br />My 6 year old son immediately started jumping on it from a couch and had a blast. He then settled down on it and played some games on an iPad, so there's no doubt he likes it.<br /><br />I'm happy I spent a little more for what is most likely a significantly better quality bag that has a removable & washable cover. I'm also happy that I am supporting jobs in the USA, which I don't mind at all doing when they offer a higher quality product that is worth the additional cost over cheaper & lower quality Chinese made products.<br /><br />Unfortunately the 4' was too big for us but the customer service was excellent and helped us convert it into 2x 2' bag chairs by exchanging the cover & bags. I transferred the foam 'stuffing' from the 4' to the 2x 2' bags.<br /><br />By the way, currently the photo for the 2' navy bag with the child sitting on it shows a lighter blue color. The actual color is a darker navy blue as you might expect.<br /><br />Here's some size info:<br /><br />The 2' size has a diameter of 34&#34; and is 20&#34; high<br />The 3' size has a diameter of 44&#34; and is 24&#34; high.<br />The 4' size has a diameter of 48&#34; and is 27&#34; high.<br />The 5' size has a diameter of 48&#34; and is 40&#34; high.<br /><br />So 5 stars from me... should anything change then I'll definitely update this review.\",\n",

If you want to read me complain that this DVD shortens it, well that was it.  Lucia is a dreamer. One day she meets the man of her dreams, Jose Simon but he doesn't have eyes for her. She's poor and he's one of the wealthiest men in Peru. While working at a flower shop she meets Roberto, whom she believes is also poor. She initially doesn't like him but soon they become friends. What Lucia does not know is that he is actually Jose Simon's brother and also wealthy. In a series of misunderstandings Lucia re-meets Jose Simon, but this time as an Italian countess. He immediately falls for her, or is it for her money? Now Lucia must decide if she loves the wealthy Jose Simon or the poor Roberto?  This novella ranks up in my top 3 of all time. While you don't get to see the entire series they do a decent job of showing you how things transpire. If you are debating getting this after never seeing I recommend you go for it. If you were a fan of the original run, well be ready to see it shortened.\",\n",

First impression. The packaging is great. The brushes come individually packaged and the brush holder all come in a box filled with pink confetti and a very cute sticker (that I won't spoil for you:), this would make a perfect gift for any makeup lover.  When I opened the bags for each brush they emitted and awful smell. Seriously they smelt awful which was an initial turn off. I immediately washed them my preferred way, with baby shampoo, and the smell was gone. I am still not fan of the idea that the brushes came loaded with chemicals but this is the only con.    The brushes are AMAZING. Incredibly dense and full yet incredibly soft and pick up makeup so well. These apply effortlessly and really give your skin an airbrushed look. So easy to use yet so effective. These brushes are far better than Sigma's kabuki though somewhat different, Sigma's have a slightly larger head and are fluffier however these are denser and equally as soft as Sigmas and I find the denseness gives a better application. I won't be using my Sigma again any time soon. These brushes also have a great weight to them. Very heavy duty wood handle with a sturdy metal ferrule, you can tell the quality just by holding them.    On top of this Beauty Junkees has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced. When I received the kit the leather tube was too small to hold all the brushes and I was very confused. I contacted the seller who responded right away and said they had made their brushes denser which in return caused them to be larger and they no longer all fit in the tube. She told me they were in the process of making a new larger tube and offered to send me one when they were completed in a few months. Well during this time the seller kept me up to date on the production of their tubes andsure enough I received one via priority mail wrapped in pink tissue paper. This tube is perfect for holding all the brushes and is a beautiful leather and very very solid. Beauty junkees truly cares about their customers satisfaction and was extremely kind and prompt in their response. I have since bought several of their other products because I value their great quality and great customer service.    Can't go wrong with this brush or this company.\",\n",

And it's held up.<br /><br />It's first important for me to mention that this is a very good guitar ***at this price point***.  Indeed, parts of this guitar certainly exceeded my expectations, with the fit and finish of the wood being really quite good.  On mine, some hardware (switches, dials, etc) was wobbly in the fittings so I did need to take some time to address those points.  On the other hand, the tuners were nice right out of the box.  So go figure.<br /><br />It also bears mentioning, clearly, that this is a Chinese product.  Sure, it says &#34;crafted&#34; in China, but it's still not of this shore so if that bothers you, well, there you go.  I don't have a problem with it as this is not a keepsake instrument, but even that said this instrument has surprised me at times, making it easy for me to overlook the country of origin.  However,  like other Chinese &#34;crafts,&#34; sometimes you can see the choices they made that gets you to that attractive price point.  For instance, this has a rosewood fingerboard.  Rosewood in and of itself isn't bad, but I don't think it's the best choice on this style of guitar (my opinion, don't shoot me).  It's cheaper than the alternatives though, so that's probably why it's there.<br /><br />I've seen some consistency issues across the line as well.  For instance, the color of mine is more of a washed out blue, approaching a bluish lavender in fact.<br /><br />Tone on this is VERY surprising.  It sounds great!  Seriously, it's got this kind of timbre to it that I can't describe.  It reminds me of the kid that grew up poor but ended up going to high school in the rich part of town.  It's going to try harder and it brings something unique.  Ditch the factory strings and put some good 'uns on there, and I think you'll be happy with the result.<br /><br />For an informal instrument where you don't feel like spending the green for a name brand, this one works quite well.  Again, it's fun for me to just jam on without worrying about turning heads because of the name on headpiece.  I like this instrument.  A lot.\",\n",

This is a great system and the system will either stack or it can be turned to nest on the one beneath it... which comes in handy if you have some trays that aren't full you can get a few more in the bucket. I read some reviews on these and don't quite get what the complaints are about. I get my 5 gallon buckets from emptying paint or spackle and there's no way I can get enough items into these trays to come anywhere near the weight when these buckets were full of what originally came in it. I have lots of screws & nails but I'd guess that only about 2/3 of the space in each tray is useable because of the way they're built so I'd say my heaviest bucket maxes out at about 30 pounds. I have about 20 of these trays and another 10 of another kind [[ASIN:B00023S8JU Custom LeatherCraft 1152 2?-Inch High, Full-Round Bucket Tray]] so I can have a dedicated bucket for nails, screws, plumbing parts, electrical parts and one for my drip-line watering system parts. If money is no object then I don't think you can do much better than this brand. That said, I'm buying LeatherCraft for about 4 bucks a tray, including shipping, because I'm cheap and it's a decent line though the handles are inferior to the ones on the Bucket Boss. This is, in my opinion, 5-stars all the way. If there's a downside to these it's that the dividers are much thicker than they really need to be and that diminishes the space you have in the tray.\",\n",

The light not only brightened up every inch of the music on the stand but also my entire 88-key keyboard, without blinding a single audience member. The LED lights never produce heat, allowing me to adjust the light at any time without risk of burning myself. The flexible neck allows for any creative positioning imaginable, holding any position for an unlimited amount of time.<br /><br />If there is anything to critique, it is the clip itself, which doesn't hold quite as securely to my music stand as I would hope, though there is no risk of it falling off, it just may wiggle a bit. However, once it is set to my liking, it really only wiggles when I try to do so. No movement occurs just from setting a book on the stand or turning pages.<br /><br />Although I haven't used it for any purposes beside reading music, I'm sure other creative uses would prove effective as well. The option to either use AC power or batteries is very nice, as you don't need to waste battery power when you can conveniently plug it in. Keep a twist-tie or rubber band handy though, as the power cord is quite long.<br /><br />The bag is nice for storing and keeping off dust when not in use.

I already own the popular Baofeng UV-5R, and the new UV-B5 is even better. The UV-B5 feels more like a quality radio than the UV-5R. Most of the features are similar. The UV-B5 has slightly less channels (99), but has a channel knob instead of the LED flashlight. Programming is a little easier, but like the UV-5R, you'll want to buy the optional programming cable. Using the software from Baofeng, you can also expand the UHF RX frequency range to 520MHZ. The latest daily builds of CHIRP also work, but not the advanced settings or programming above 470MHZ (as of June, 2013).

If you haven't already looked at this you should: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FLUB76?tag=i60-20  Something to beware of: Tool manufacturers to include those of flashlights are stamping items &#34;&#34;U.S.A.&#34;&#34; vs &#34;&#34;Made in U.S.A.&#34;&#34; due to some or most of a widget's parts/build process being performed offshore then in some fashion assembled in USA.  About the set: Heavy steel; lengths: 12&#34;&#34; OAL w/a ~2.1&#34;&#34; jaw drop, 9.5&#34;&#34;OAL w/a ~ 1.2&#34;&#34; jaw drop, and 6.75&#34;&#34;OAL w/a ~ 0.75&#34;&#34; jaw drop while closed; very good thick rubber-type handle coverings which actually feel thicker than my 40-y/o set (could be due to wear); exposed metal has some sort of heavy lacquer finish for corrosion prevention, something I don't recall on old set; water pump pivot pin is a big rivet vs lag bolt w/ self-locking nut...Hmmm, I personally like those w/ self-locking nut (older ones same size have) but perhaps the larger size pumps made today have lags/SL nuts, not sure.  The `apex' screwdriver is stamped &#34;&#34;CHANNELLOCK&#34;&#34; which means something in itself; has a 'corn cob' handle -- it's beefy by comparison and should perform well esp with longer high-carbon cross-tip bits.  If you're a picky B when it comes to hand tools, I think you'll like this set.  Update: Something's odd with screwdriver (shaft pulls from handle - I finally figure out lol). It has a reversible 5/16 inch bit (Phillips/flat) which has a receiver ball to remain attached.  And, apparently a bit with same type receiver ball (1/4inch bit) must be used on opposing side (ordinary bits fall right out lol)...hmmm\",\n",

It takes really sharp images, especially macro.<br /><br />I've read some complaints that you need a tripod to shoot macro otherwise you can't get it focus or get a blurry photo. However, my experience has been different. I've had absolutely no trouble shooting at 300mm in macro holding it with just my hands. I was absolutely shocked at how detailed and clean the image was, especially since it doesn't have image stabilization.<br /><br />My dad was visiting and he was blown away with the image quality of the lens. He was even taking some photos with it and said he was impressed with how fast it took photos. I trust his opinion a lot because he's been doing photography for almost 40 years, if not longer.<br /><br />If you want a very nice macro lens you really cant go wrong with the Sigma. I would give it more stars if I could because that's how good it is.<br /><br />Update 4-27-14<br /><br />So far I'm still enjoying the lens but I'm starting to notice the auto-focus isn't very good. It zooms in and out multiple times and still wont focus. Sometimes it does focus, other times it takes multiple tries before it works. I've got into the habit of just manually focusing since it's faster and the pictures seem to be more clear than using AF. I'm not deducting a star because I still believe the lens is great for the price and still takes really nice images. The AF problem is more of an annoyance than anything for me.\",\n",

              " (\"There are a number of models in Ernie Ball’s pedal series with different features and Amazon will often combine reviews, which (IMO) can be confusing.  To be clear, I’m talking about the MVP 6162 – the straight mono volume pedal plus a tuner jack. There’s no stereo pan functionality and, although the instruction sheet doesn’t specify, based on performance it’s a good bet the pedal uses a 250k audio-taper pot similar to the 6166 and 6180 models – best suited for passive guitar and bass pickups.  I don't usually comment on other reviews but incorrect info shouldn't go unchallenged when it can mislead people. Anyone who says this pedal won't fully cut off volume is wrong or isn’t using it correctly: There are minimum and maximum sweep knobs and turning the minimum knob fully counter-clockwise gives you a heel position that fully cuts off volume (or as fully as turning down the volume pot on your instrument will – I’m not talking scientific detection of incidental line noise/interference here - just practical 'off').  The minimum knob also allows you to set the lower volume ‘floor’ – meaning if you don’t want to fully cut off volume you can maintain some level at the pedal’s full-heel position.  Why might you want to do this? Consistency for one: In a dynamic playing context, you may not have time to tweak the pedal position just so. Quickly going full-heel, confident you’re at the level you want,  can be a real convenience (and your sound person/recording engineer will thank you – even if it’s yourself).  At the other end the maximum knob is somewhat more intuitive:  it allows you to set the toe-full-down maximum volume. By experimenting with min and max settings you can vary the sweep from heel to toe along with the absolute floor and ceiling volume. If you’ve only used a volume pedal with a single fixed sweep – and you wished for either a ‘tighter’ or more-gradual swell, the MVP will provide some useful and possibly more expressive and comfortable options.  In case you’re wondering, turning both the max and min knobs fully down does not give you an ‘anti-volume’ pedal with zero sound, it sets a fairly wide sweep from full off to a relatively low-level maximum.  I got the MVP to replace my trusty-but-scratchy 40+ year-old DeArmond pedal I've had since I discovered as a kid in the 70's that Steve Howe used one. I'm a lefty and lefty instruments were rare and pricey so I converted my own guitars, leaving the knobs on the right-hand side. Because of that I could never manage that Roy Buchanan pinky-twist move with the volume pot and needed a pedal to get 'violin' tones and textures (the EBow was still a couple of years away).  Speaking of comfort, the MVP toe-down position lies parallel to the floor while the DeArmond has a 15-20 degree angle that I always found easy on my ankle – especially if I’m doing a lot of fast movements. It wouldn’t be hard to devise a large wooden shim for the MVP if you feel the same way.  The MVP pedal action is much tighter compared to the DeArmond and I prefer  that because it makes fine control easier (no doubt decades of use have loosened up the DeArmond but even in its prime I remember wishing it were a little stiffer). One thing the DeArmond has that the MVP doesn’t is a side-to-side tone pot function – granted it’s cheesy and will cost you even more in tone than the volume pot itself does, but it’s there. Speaking of impact on pure signal, I couldn’t detect much loss with the MVP – although as always, the longer your cables the more potential degradation.  The MVP’s 3/16” brushed aluminum casing is rugged, has nice mass to sit tight without being excessively heavy, and looks great. The flat, rubberized foot surface has nice ‘tooth’ to it that’s comfortable to use wearing shoes or not.  The min/max knobs are heavy metal (no pun intended) and have solid turn ratios.  I wish the battery door were metal rather than plastic but I like that it’s hinged otherwise it would just scream ‘lose me!’. The battery sits close to the surface and is easy to fish in and out. The review pedal didn’t come with a power supply but I prefer batteries when recording - power supplies can add noise especially at low levels.  If I were back in my club-gig days, tossing equipment in and out of dark trunks, I might question the open access to the pedal’s internal components under the foot control – too easy to get picks and other small items stuck in there and it could be a pain to shake them out.  I can’t comment on the tuner jack function (I’m old school tuning fork and ears).  Bottom Line: The MVP makes for a more flexible-functioning and quieter volume pedal than traditional fixed sweep pedals.  And in this age of ever-thinner plastics the top-notch workmanship is much appreciated.  I’ll still keep my DeArmond for sentimental reasons but the MVP will surely be my go-to volume pedal from now on.\",\n",

I am, and have always been, a city dweller.  My dad did not leave when I was small.  I was not raised by my mother and grandmother.  I am old enough for Sowers to be my son.  One would assume Sowers and I have little in common except our gender.  However, I like real stories about real people.  The stories Sowers tells are real.  Sowers is &#34;real.&#34;  He opens his heart and soul, holds nothing back; his fears, failures, shortcomings, doubts, thoughts.  He puts it all &#34;out there.&#34;  No, actually he brings you &#34;in there,&#34; into his real life, his real feelings, his real everything.  As Sowers permitted me to be a part of his private life, I found myself going in a different direction.

Reflecting upon the book, I have concluded Sowers had some help; divine I suspect.  Although there no &#34;preachy&#34; words or phrases anywhere in the book, make no doubt about it, the book is deeply spiritual.  It comes from a place deep within a writer who obviously has a genuine connection to the Source from which he draws much of what makes this book so special, so relevant, so personal and so vital.  I frankly think his book has something for every man, the best book of its type since Wild At Heart.  But this one will take you deeper within yourself than Wild At Heart.

This book is inspiring as it is factual, in my opinion.<br /><br />Besides following the exercises clearly outlined in this book, I also began researching and eventually taking a combination of nutritional supplements called nootropics (i.e. piractem, aniracetam, etc).  They were first discovered 30+ years ago and were used to treat serious medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.  Then after scientists began recommending them as cognitive enhancers to the public, they started to become a very popular brain supplement.<br /><br />They are a very intriguing family of supplements.  My suggestion to anyone looking to improve their brain function is to look into some type of natural brain supplement, everyone is different so do your own research like I did and decide for yourself if it's a good idea.  Besides experimenting with a few nootropics, I've been taking ginseng and ginko for years, [[ASIN:B009K30D28 Ginseng Complex Plus Royal Jelly (1000 Mg) + FREE Ginkgo Biloba Extract (30 Mg) 60 Tablets]].  They're inexpensive and effective, plain and simple.<br /><br />And of course if you haven't already, read this book which, for me, was my personal inspiration and the beginning of my journey to a better me; [[ASIN:1594480931 The Better Brain Book]].\",\n",

I am using this with the Home Dynamix no slip rug pad and I am very happy with the combination of products.  This room sized rug is very attractive, nice cushion to it and very soft.  The colors are a tiny bit brighter than the picture but not by much at all.  The most concerning factor to me was the odor some people have mentioned in their reviews... fortunately for me there was absolutely NO odor at all.  I was able to put this out myself, no help needed.  Nice quality rug while I got a deal on it, it is definitely worth the full price.  I would buy this brand again.\",\n",

              " (\"This carrier has been great. There are three main things I love about it.<br /><br />1. It was a waist belt. A lot of carriers that can have the baby front facing only have the shoulder straps. Those kill your back after a while. I can hold my 20 pound baby for quite a while with no back pain.<br /><br />2. It's really easy to adjust. My husband and I both use this product quite often. My husband is about 8 in. taller than me, so this is a must for us. Not only is it easy to adjust, it's pretty quick too.<br /><br />3. There are several carrying positions. There are 4 to be exact. Facing you narrow seat, facing you wide seat, facing out, and backpack. The facing you narrow seat is great when the baby is too small to wrap their legs around you. This is a problem with most ergonomic baby carriers. Then when the baby is big enough, you can use the facing you wide seat, which is the safest position for babies in carriers-especially for longer periods of time. Facing out is great when baby can hold their head up and want to explore. I haven't used the backpack carry yet, but I imagine that will be very helpful as my baby grows.<br /><br />There's only one drawback in this carrier. It's hard to change from the wide seat to the narrow seat. It's very hard to get the toggles and buttons through the holes. This may just be to keep the carrier more secure though, so it may be a good thing.<br /><br />It's a great carrier. I'd recommend it to anyone.\",\n",

The cable itself is heavily molded and doesn't seem as fragile as other similar dongles, so it should stand up to years of abuse. The device is relatively small but obviously the box end is larger than a single DVI or VGA adapter, and measures about twice the length of an Apple DVI dongle and about 70-80% the length of most of my 3rd party dongles. On the other hand, it is thinner than my other dongles which helps in the bag. Considering you'd need three separate adapters, you could be reducing your carry weight by over 4-fold.\",\n",

              " (\"We recently adopted a cat wanted to start with a few items to make her comfortable.  Remembering how much the cats I had as a kid loved sitting in the window, this seemed like it would be a good fit.  When it arrived, my first impression was that it was easy to assemble and install, looked attractive, and seemed very comfortable.  Under the cover is a layer of egg-crate style foam with what seems to be a waterproof layer over that.  Then comes the actual cover and bolster.  The cover is soft and plush and the bolster is covered with a smooth fabric.  This all fits over a plastic frame.  While the frame doesn't feel overly heavy-duty, it does seem adequate.  Our cat is pretty small, only about six pounds, so I can't say how this would hold up to a 20 pound cat.<br /><br />There are two ways to install this.  You can use the enclosed screws and simply screw them into the window sill.  Slide the cover over and you're done.  This is what we did.  Also, there are two velcro strips, though I can't say how they would work.  I would imagine the tapes from Command hooks could be a possibility for damage-free installation, too.  The velcro (and Command tapes) need to sit for a time before you use the product.<br /><br />The bolster is always shown on the window side, which seems backward to me, but you can put the cover on with the bolster either side.  The bolster also zips off.  Our cat likes to sit on the perch, back away from the window against the bolster.  She seems quite comfortable, spends a lot of time there, and has made herself comfortable in her new home.  We are happy with our decision and would highly recommend this product.\",\n",

This car seat carrier is for carrying your baby, in an infant car seat, to and from places where you would not bring a stroller or carrier (e.g. a restaurant, friends houses).  Even a short two-three minute walk from a parking space to your destination can be very difficult while lugging a heavy and cumbersome car seat.  The seat bangs against the side of your leg, makes it very difficult to carry diapers bags or other things, and limits your ability to help your other kiddos (if you have them).

It was clearly cheap molded plastic with sharp seam edges (think 1970s toxic junk you do NOT want your kid\\'s mouth on that back then no one knew was toxic -- now with extra BPA!) and even worse, everything and I mean EVERYTHING in the sealed plastic wrap was covered in this gross, smoky, smelly, black soot. I mean really smelly. Like it sat behind the smokestack and next to the cigarette smokers on the trip overseas. Now I know this was made in China and of course I intended to wash it before putting it together BUT this was SO flithy I ended up putting each piece in the shower and the water ran black!<br /><br />But it was still covered in sooty grossness. First I tried green cleaners (the husband was telling me how we need this as our LO is just about to walk and she\\'s in that I-need-to-cling-to-mommy-at-all-moments phase, which is cute, but hard to cook dinner or do laundry, so would I just PLEASE try to clean it and PLEASE give it a try???) and they didn\\'t touch this stuff.

Still factory employee fingerprinted black filth all over and by now there was that noxious bad plastic smell from the medium-warm shower water (I didn\\'t want it to melt, just be clean).

The stickers for the decorations had all peeled off in transit (stick stickers to black dirt and they do not stick) so I didn\\'t have to worry about them until later (Glue on?).<br /><br />But really, I wanted to return it from the get-go because it was gross and cleaning took FOREVER (DD was napping) but DH was home from work, saw the last panel, and he agreed it was filthy. But I almost finally finished cleaning it. I was at the point of thinking well after all that, I *could* cover the bars and top with our cloth crib rails and guardcover....and that might be okay for short periods of time and then DD hopefully wouldn\\'t ingest something toxic or really be in contact with the plastic monstrosity....<br /><br />But then I tried to put this sucker together. Now I\\'m the one who usually does the putting together from all our computers and electronics to home repairs to assembling furniture from ikea (the bed is a beast, don\\'t do it!), so plastic and screws no problem, right? By the time I got to the third panel, I discovered the bolts for many of the screws after all that cleaning were not made right and they would not fit without my doing metal work and readjusting the threads. So back this toxic nightmare went!<br /><br />We do like the big Graco bugs pack n play, but we were looking for something for the other end of the house and \"new\" so DD would find it more interesting than what she has and I didn\\'t want to unload the toys from the family room, move the graco, and reload every single time the dryer is done or it\\'s mealtime.

However, I can guarantee you that you're not going to think it's awesome if your PC isn't up to specs.<br /><br />I've been a PC gamer since Wolfenstein, Doom, etc, so I started the COD series with...COD -- the original!  I've bought every COD game since then, and at times, yes, they ran horribly for me, but that was my fault for being a cheapo and not upgrading my system.  Sometimes, you just have priorities in life other than keeping the latest, greatest hardware in your PC, but when that happens you really shouldn't hate on the latest game(s) simply because you have an inadequate system.  Again, i want to emphasize -- I know.  I've been there.  I try to string along my PC hardware as long as I possibly can.  For the last six years I've been using a dual core in a MediaPC case that used to be my homemade DVR before I went with DirecTV.  I wasn't able to play the original Black Ops at all or even World at War.  All the Modern Warefare titles worked at mediocre (or less) settings.  Recently I decided it was time for a long past-due upgrade, so I built a Core i7-4770 based system with 16GB RAM, a GTX 660 w/2GB GDDR5, and Windows 7 x64.  Not the fastest/latest, but not a slouch system by any means.  It plays COD Ghosts at maximum everything video related as if it was a CGI movie.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed that the solo missions aren't there like in the MW titles, but I haven't really looked into all the multiplayer options, so there may be something in there that will entertain me after the campaign.<br /><br />In regard to all the one-star reviews, I guess I should thank you, as I highly suspect that's why the price was already lowered by $10 for this game when I bought it.  It's simple, folks -- update your system or don't buy the latest and greatest games and expect to play that with a maxed out configuration.  Welcome to PC gaming.  This isn't a gaming console that never needs upgrading.<br /><br />Edit:  They lost a star from me because there are no solo missions other than zombies, which I don't care for at all.\",\n",

Now my left (laptop) side of the table lists down about four inches.  If they could replace the support bar with something made of a strong metal (I'm surprised this wasn't the case originally, since otherwise it seems to be pretty well built), I'd be happy.  Otherwise, it's now useless to me.  I've tried several different things to prop it up, but without the pipe being replaced with something sturdier, it just won't work.  ********* I assembled it in about 30 minutes, and it's just what I needed.  I have another similar one I bought several years ago which is heavier-duty, but it also cost about three times as much.  For the price and utility this was a great choice.

It looks stylish on any woman's wrist and is appropriate for most occasions.

This village, whic was a poor and sparsely populated little collection of houses and buildings in the middle of nowhere even years ago, is now pretty much abandoned, semi-mythical even, and though Map King's fellow cabrivers have heard of it, none has a clue just where it's supposed to be.  Upon taking the job, the driver is told by the stranger, who goes by the name of Pony, to lead the way and he'll follow along behind in his truck.  Along the way of the hours-long drive, the two converse by CB radio, and we hear quite a bit about the history of the Moon and Sun village and the rumors surrounding it.<br /><br />This movie is done in the general style of Hero (the Jet Li one) and The Usual Suspects, as more than one account of past events is related to the viewer by different characters.  Apparently, some great tragedy happened in the village some years back.  But what was it really, and are either of the characters, as they continue talking, really telling the full truth?  About one third of the movie takes place in the present, the rest in flashbacks that sometimes (deliberately) contradict each other.  The title of the film refers to the belief in a number of Asian religions and cultures that the spirit of a recently deceased can return to its loved ones seven days after death.<br /><br />If you want to find faults to take issue with, it's not that hard: the movie is limited a mite by an obviously low budget, certain special effects leave something to be desired, and a couple of moments seem to have a vaguely humorous air that I don't think was intentional.  However, focusing on those shortcomings is kind of seeing the glass as ten per cent empty rather than ninety percent full.  The movie as a whole is original and truly suspenseful, has some good frights, good acting and a very interesting angle for characterization, in the form of 'which parts of the flashbacks about any given character are right, if any'.  It's also got some unexpectedly moving scenes that might prompt a non-horror fan who enjoys dramas to take a chance on this particular horror movie.  Many Asian movies, whether horror, action, or otherwise, end up inserting a bit more of an emotional punch than one might expect.  And, as usual, these kind of elements don't interfere with other elements (like the scare factor or the mystery factor); instead the different components tend to make one another more powerful.  I haven't seen any other movie that's quite like this one, and despite the occasional shortcoming, The First Seventh Night is recommended all the way.  Four-and-a-half stars.\",\n",

I bought this one because it has far more programming options than the simple mechanical timers.  More importantly, it has an internal, rechargeable battery to backup the programming, so it's not lost in an outage.  It's not clear to me whether the battery can be replaced, so I hope that it lasts a long time.<br /><br />At first I was feeling pretty smug because it seemed that the programming was completely straight-forward.  'What were all those reviewers complaining about?' I thought.  Then I discovered that I had missed a programming step and had to do it again.  Humbled, I decided that I would ding my rating by one star because of the non-intuitive programming.  Also, either the daylight savings adjustment doesn't work or I haven't figured out the correct way to activate it.<br /><br />So Far, it's been reliable through numerous short and moderate outages.  I also like that it's designed so that it doesn't cover both outlet sockets.  I can still plug something else into the second socket.\",\n",

I had a bicycle headlight; but apparently, the driver didn’t see me.<br />I was pretty banged up—but thankfully, I was able to walk away from the crash. My bike sustained serious damage, I was bleeding, but all x-rays were negative. Whew.<br />Among the “casualties” was my bicycle headlight. The driver agreed to replace it.<br />She meant to give me $20 for a new one. I think she mistakenly gave me $40. I called her to return the money to her. She felt badly about the whole thing, and didn’t really want to come back for the money. She also was pretty sure she gave me the correct amount.<br />I proposed a compromise: I said, “I’ll tell you what; I’ll use the extra $$$ to purchase a better headlight; that way, “next time” we can proactively attempt to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.<br />She loved the idea.<br />So, with $40 to spend, and now looking for a top-quality headlight, I found your product—for $39.97!

I do pump distilled water through my fogger after every use to clean it.  I did dilute Swamp Juice per their instructions for small machines.  However, my fogger quit pumping.  I took it apart and found that the line from the tank to the pump was clogged.  With what?  Well, I couldn\\'t tell until I saw it floating in the original Swamp Juice container.  It looks like hair conditioner - little floaties of white gel-like substance.  The solution:  I now filter the Swamp juice from it\\'s container through a coffee filter and into my clean container when I dilute it.  Problem solved and fogger saved.  But, I gotta knock the Swamp Juice at least a star as I followed their instructions on mixing for my machine and,  were I not able to diagnose & fix the problem, my machine would now need replacing.  Filter your juice.  NOTE:  I ran distilled water and a bit of vinegar through my machine to clear all the lines of the blockage.

It would pump out fog, but it just never seemed to hang around very long and would dissipate immediately if I turned on the ceiling fans or ac.  And many times people would cough or complain about the fog smell.  Well, ALL OF THAT IS A THING OF THE PAST and that juice is now in the garbage....<br /><br />Froggy\\'s Fog Swamp Juice is the cat\\'s meow!  It filled the entire house with fog in no time.  In less than 30 minutes, my little $30 fog machine had the entire 1800 square foot house so filled with fog that when people were coming and going and they\\'d open the front door fog would billow out like the house was on fire, I\\'m not kidding.  The ac and ceiling fans were even going!  After getting the fog look I wanted (the saturated-house on fire look), I\\'d only need to hit the fog button for like 1/3 bursts every 20 minutes or so to maintain.  The hang-time is amazing.  It REALLY lingers.  We laughed as we went to bed and realized that the bedroom in the other end of the house still had fog hours after the party / fogging had ended.  lol<br /><br />My Dj lights are given new life!  I\\'ve never seen them create such awesome looking light beams before.  I need to go back and edit those light reviews to all 5 stars now.<br /><br />There is NO SMELL and no complaints by anybody of such.  No clogging even after leaving it in the machine for a few days.  I did cut it with 1/3 distilled water as directed by Froggy\\'s for my machine.  And, to my surprise, even after \"setting the house on fire\" I hardly used any Swamp Juice - just 2 ounces.  I expect years out of a gallon.  Thank you Froggy\\'s.  I had originally thought that there\\'s no way I\\'m paying near $30 a gallon for fog juice.  This, however, is an instance where you get what you pay for...and you\\'re getting alot.<br /><br />I\\'m not easy to impress and more times than not, I have had to learn to accept \"lowered expectations\".  Not so here.  Folks, I know that this is just fog machine juice, but for me, after what I have seen, Froggy\\'s Swamp Juice is the ONLY fog machine juice for me.  I am impressed!',\n",

I moved the old radio to the master bedroom where I only use it occasionally and put this new one in my large (2000sq/ft) garage. I paired this with an impedance balancing speaker switch box that would allow me to hook it to four speakers without drawing too much current and frying the amp. Even though the speakers are different brands, their tonal quality and impedance are very similar. Sounds great, easily pushes the speakers and gets more than loud enough without going above 40% on the volume. The bonus is that it takes up less than 25% of the shelf space of the old receiver.
