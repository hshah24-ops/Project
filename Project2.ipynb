They are a total disappointment. Both appear to be man made material, not at all the quality of the first one I purchased. If there is any actual leather, it is a very thin layer over cheap man-made material. They not only look cheap, but they feel worse. The color is off and it doesn't even feel good for fake leather. The black one has threads hanging off of several edges that are clearly man-made (there's no stitching on these). Unfortunately I didn't inspect them when I received them, 30 days elapsed and I can't return them. They're so disappointing that I don't even want to keep them as spares no matter how little I paid for them. I hate to just throw them away, but I'd be embarrassed to give them to anyone.   Original review - 1st purchase: This is a single layer fairly thick strap of sturdy leather with a suede back. At full price of 16.99, it is a solid deal. Any lower, and it is a steal. Leather straps are a little tricky to buy online; You can't feel it or see the exact one you are purchasing, and every piece of leather is different. Most of the time with leather straps, you get the quality you pay for. This one appears to be an exception to that rule. But if you are looking for buttery soft fine Corinthian leather with gold stitching, you need to understand that you'll have to pay more. If you want one made from Wild Buffalo Leather or Free Range Mastodon Hide, you'll need to hitch a ride in the Tardis. If all you want is a solid deal on a basic leather strap that won't let you down, this is a safe bet. Oh and tight strap button holes? That's a good thing in my universe, as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel (on this Planet, anyhow).\",\n",

On one hand, the book is a page turner, but as a children's book (or at least children's reading level), it's hard not to be a page-turner... on the other hand, the references to the Q'uran and Allah were nearly on every single page. It was over the top. I do not have a problem with children being exposed to other cultures or other religions - but this was not exposure - this was non-stop praise for Allah. Each chapter opens with a quote from the Q'uran and nearly every page has either a person or a camel praising Allah. I don't know if it was put in there to try to add realism to the story, but it was so emphasized, it made itself way too obvious. It was a distraction to the story. I was interested in reading this book when I read the description because of the history of the US Camel Corps. I had never heard of this experiment in American history and was intrigued by the story. The camels were captured and sold in Egypt to the US government - so I get the names they used - many of which were the authentic names of actual camels and people involved in the Camel Corps. The camels bowing to pray to Allah was a bit much. Even without the non-stop indoctrination (seriously - nearly every page), the content was a bit intense for young readers. The book is listed as for grades 4-8. Even without addressing the all-Allah-all-the-time references, the subject matter seems to be beyond what I'd feel comfortable with even a 7th grader reading. Camels mating, camels killing each other, and the Egyptian cameleer anxious to go into town to get to the prostitutes. Seriously? I'm not sure what the editors were thinking and why they didn't rein some of this in. The story of the US Camel Corps is one that needs to be told - I just think there's a better way to tell this story to young children. When looking at the book as a whole - it's goal to tell the story to children, it fails as it is too mature and heavy on religious indoctrination - whether or not that was the intent of the author.\",\n",

It isn't because of the interesting extras that are more than a 'making of' film but an exploration as to how the  movies were developed and came about with insights into the actor's motivations.  It is because, at least for the first two films, the blu ray transfers are barely passable as blu ray.  In First Blood, the contrast and resolution are very soft and details are left as mush.  The audio, especially important to me, makes so little use of the surrounds and subwoofer as to be almost laughable.<br /><br />In the 2nd film, First Blood Part 11, the video transfer was better than the first, but, again, very little  use of any of the surrounds, especially the rear channels.  Both of these movies should have made ample use of the entire sound stage and who ever was responsible for this audio transfer probably took it directly off a Standard audio track and transcoded it to the higher audio compression scheme without working on the audio's master track.  While there is some use of the front left and right channels, it is very little.  My sub actually turned off at one point as there was so little low frequency info being passed.  In the second film, in an early scene when Rambo is in the jet taking off, the jet comes to the viewer and passes overhead.  You'd think that the rear channels would have been used....Nope.<br /><br />Rambo 111, the last in this set does show a marked improvement in quality over the first two films.  Set in Afghanistan, Rambo continues to do his thing, fly helicopters, ignore painful wounds and save his friend and the world.  The important thing here is a considerably crisper video transfer and the DTSHD audio actually does make use of your home theater's entire speaker system.  Good use of all discreet channels and sub, FINALLY.  The video transfer is marked by very good contrast and details in the shadow areas.  This is clearly the best transfer of the 3 films.  The lone extra is more of a half hour documentary on Afghanistan and what the culture was like previously.  This, was how America abandoned it once the USSR left with their tails between their legs allowing  the Taliban came to power.  There are no deleted scenes, outtakes, making of or any other extras.<br /><br /> I had all of these on Standard Def DVDs and hoped for a rousing infusion of visual and audio detail from the Blu Ray versions.  This collection is my first major mistake in converting my DVDs to Blu Ray.  Not worth it at any price.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks\",\n",

              " (\"Interesting book. It is better than &#34;Predictably Irrational.&#34; Indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. But even in this book, Ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make SEEMINGLY irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. Our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.<br /><br />As long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the &#34;wizard's curtain.&#34; Nevertheless, modern U.S. Government is unlike any before. Citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. A broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. Yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. In the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? Of course not. Government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and INCREASING EXPENSES. Obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. If a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.<br /><br />Citizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. And now the People are behaving just like their government. This is what government &#34;nudging&#34; has created.<br /><br />For over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. With a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. And modern U.S. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. There are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. The government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. The government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. Why? To insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. Obama oligarch, Cass Sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as &#34;nudging.&#34;<br /><br />For example, during the recent &#34;subprime mortgage crisis,&#34; which Ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, EXCEPT the supposedly rational U.S. Government. Homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. Thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. Similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. In fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did NOT make imprudent loans. Investors in those loans also acted rationally. They understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. Thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. Finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the U.S. government. First, it &#34;incentivized&#34; imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. Then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage &#34;crisis.&#34;<br /><br />Over the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. Citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. Thus, contrary to Ariely's thesis, the forces of &#34;irrationality&#34; are not hidden. Irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. In fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. For example, the 1960s &#34;Great Society&#34; and &#34;War on Poverty,&#34; created more poverty. The War on Gun Ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. The welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. Despite billions spent on education; Math, Science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. This is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. Education does not make people successful. Rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. It is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. Instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. Amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. Incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! There is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.<br /><br />It is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the &#34;Cargo Cult&#34; islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). Like modern politicians, the Cargo Cult confused correlation with causation. Citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. Many academics and intellectuals, such as Ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. That is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. This is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. Government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the U.S. has done. The best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. Despite Ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality.\",\n",

Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased Slim Fast after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on Slim Fast and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life.

It shows why there is a need for a rebuttal. Morgan attacked by book with lies as I can show. Those who then wish to proceed to the full PDF will be welcome. My web site is at PROBITYPRESS.COM.<br />JOHN MORGAN: A FRAUDSTER EXPOSED<br />IF ANYONE WISHES TO ASK QUESTIONS, OR MAKE A STATEMENT, I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO RESPOND TO YOU ALL PERSONALLY.<br />I have written a book called The Princess Diana Conspiracy that has been attacked by a fraudster called John Morgan. Morgan has written a load of rubbish about my book and said there are two hundred errors in it and then expands that onto 500. One of Morgan\\'s team of loyal \"reviewers\", Hiram, has arbitrarily increased that number to 600. It is all an exaggerated corruption.<br />This is a logical way for MI6 to progress their campaign. But they would also like you to read Morgan\\'s rubbish because he espouses corrupt inquest evidence and so supports their purpose. If you fall for it, then Diana will become a fading footnote of history but the monarchy will also be safe for another number of years until it finally succumbs to the inevitable but too late for Diana\\'s justice.<br />To all those souls that demand justice for Diana I ask you to consider the points I make. It will take a little of your time but Diana will benefit from your diligence and be closer to being avenged. You will follow my logic; most will recognize the truth having read this PDF.<br />I place you on my web, just before the PDF.<br />God bless<br />Alan<br /><br />JOHN MORGAN: AN UNPLEASANT BUT NECESSARY REBUTTAL<br />INTRODUCTION<br />An unpleasant task follows; one I cannot sidestep. Someone called John Morgan from Brisbane, Australia has compiled several books about Diana over the last few years taken directly from the Diana inquest transcripts. My book is sellingwell; his aren\\'t selling. He has attacked my book with a criminal, so called, \"review\" that is false so I must put the record straight. Morgan\\'s books are seriously flawed but I must also illustrate his purpose in writing his odious and corrupt little so called \"review\". Here is a free PDF download. I ask that you please make the ultimate judgement.<br />OVERVIEW<br />My book, the Princess Diana Conspiracy, has sold well and convinced many people about Diana being murdered; this hasn\\'t pleased MI6. They tried to prevent my book from reaching the US market by sending my first book shipment back to the UK. Amazon.com was also later persuaded that my book was made of \"hazardous materials\"; this prevented it\\'s availability around the time I was on four US TV shows and five US radio shows in September which was a critical time for my book\\'s exposure. I also appeared on the Geraldo at Large show in New York and wasn\\'t told I would be met by Imogen Lloyd Webber (MI6) who tried hard to debunk my views. Now MI6 recruit a failed author to assist them.<br />MI6 use Morgan\\'s services because he is more concerned about money than justice for Diana. He has written several boring, disastrous books and has latched onto \"The Princess Diana Conspiracy\" to advertise them. He wrote his \"review\" based on his flawed opinions, not facts. Despite acknowledging that the inquests evidence is corrupt, he uses this same material to debunk my book and to write all of his own books; it is all he has. How anyone can write an account of what happened to Diana by using this same corrupt evidence and without challenging it, escapes me. MI6 had ten years to sanitize evidence and Morgan\\'s views reflect the inquests findings, thus showing that he supports MI6.<br />I show that a huge number from Morgan\\'s list of my supposed \"errors\" are either complete nonsense, his ignorance of the pre inquest evidence or his own baseless opinions. Morgan suggests his opinionsare indisputable and other \"errors\" are what he calls my \"Power Constructs\"; these are where he doesn\\'t accept the evidence I present because he doesn\\'t possess it. All are my supposed \"errors\" and a large number of examples are shown in the PDF. Morgan didn\\'t start looking into the details about this vile crime until 2006. I began in 2003 so I use this pre inquest evidence to challenge the evidence that emerged from the inquest. Morgan perversely extolls the inquest evidence whilst also stating it is corrupt.<br />He attacks me by saying that \"All investigative books-I include my own-have some errors. That is not the issue. The issue here is the level and type of error\". So he pins the justification for his attack not on any errors but on the level and type of my supposed errors that apparently indicate I am working with MI6 (I am not). So, if you are content that the examples I show in the PDF illustrate Morgan\\'s point is rubbish, and you may even regard his comments as pathetic, you will clearly see his purpose.<br />This was not a labour of love but done out of necessity. If we are to have justice and bring the truth to light then I need to clarify Morgan\\'s purpose and send him to your mercy; not of my choice. Please find the time to read the full review on my web and take your own stance. Don\\'t let this man pervert the course of justice now when my book takes us so close. Demand justice for Diana, Princess of Wales and deny MI6 their hard fought for victory.<br />PDF FOLLOWS ON WEB<br /> (I did make mistakes in The Princess Diana Conspiracy and have apologised. But these genuine errors were corrected and published as an eBook three weeks before Morgan\\'s corruption emerged so his pathetic comments about my MI6 association and raising false flags etc., by deliberately giving out false information, are proven untruths; he knew I was pursuing justice. I had already corrected the genuine errors earlier so clearly wasn\\'t trying to laya false trail. Please understand this point because it\\'s the bedrock of Morgan\\'s excuse for his corruption and proves this man is a criminal. I have now finished a review of my entire book and it is being typeset; it will be with the printers next week and also an update will be sent for the eBook. I shall also be extra careful when I send the files to the printers this time to ensure they arrive intact-more later.)',\n",

I understand that lead has been entering the River Yangtze and East China Sea as a result of poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen 1999). Water irrigations systems for farms obtain water from the River Yangtze! As a result the tea plants do get contaminated with lead. Even organic farms in China are at risk. In 2006 Han et al showed that 32% of 1225 tea samples from China contained lead at levels that exceed the maximum permissible concentration. In 2013 Consumer Lab dot com advised people not to consume matcha from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha! The only way to be sure about the purity of the matcha is to see a lab report on the amount of lead in the matcha. Lead can damage any organ in the body including the brain, causing learning and behavioural problems and also problems with doing arithmetic or language problems.<br />I think it is important that a lab report on lead content of the matcha is uploaded on to Amazon by one organic as it is a matter of food safety. Until then I will not drink this matcha which clearly says on the back of the pack that it is a \"Product of China”. It is an important issue.

After reading the Amazon reviews for various competing mini-pie makers, I ordered this well-reviewed SUNBEAM 4-PIECE PIE MAKER.  Little did I know what it had in store for me!<br /><br />I followed the booklet\\'s recipe for blueberry mini-pies to the letter.  I lightly oiled the pie cups, preheated the pie maker, used the provided tool to cut top and bottom crusts from Pillsbury ready-made crusts, prepared the filling, used the provided tool to press the bottom crusts into the pie maker, measured 1/2 cup of filling into each bottom crust, added the top crusts, and clamped the top of the pie maker shut.<br /><br />The pie maker began emitting steam, which seemed odd.  After 10 minutes, the pie crusts were done.  However, the pie filling had boiled out onto the pie-maker plates, and a lot of it had spilled down the outside and into the hinges.  Because the pie-maker plates were hot, the filling was busily burning onto the plates.  As I was removing the mini-pies, the bottom of one burst and dropped all its filling.  The final straw was my husband\\'s comment that his intact mini-pie seemed \"kind of filled with air\"!<br /><br />Oh well.  Maybe I should have used one of the booklet\\'s two recipes for pie crusts--although the booklet did say you could use ready-made crusts from the grocery store.  Or maybe I should have crimped the top and bottom crusts together--although the instructions did not say to do this, and the plates look like they will do the crimping when you close the lid.<br /><br />The cleanup was such a nightmare, I have no desire to ever use this appliance again.  The mini-pies are cute, but the preparation time is about the same as for a full-sized, double-crust blueberry pie (except that a 9\" pie needs 45 minutes to bake).  Also, the mini-pies don\\'t hold much filling, especially if you have to use less than 1/2 cup of filling.

The game is designed completely around the need for the real-money auction house to compete and do well in the end-game. The difficulty curve in the final stages of the game is so absurd and the loot system is so obscenely weighted against you in terms of probabilities to actually receive an upgrade, that you have no choice but to farm for hours on end to afford to purchase upgrades from the auction house. This game could have been named: \"The World of Auctions\" and it would have at least not been as big a let down as slapping the Diablo franchise on the front of the box.<br /><br />One month into the game, Blizzard releases the real money auction house. Now the auction house that uses the in-game currency (Gold) is a barren wasteland of good loot. It\\'s meh-mediocre at best. Anything very good to great gets slapped on the Real-money auction house for 25 bucks or more, sometimes 250 bucks. It\\'s ridiculous. But here\\'s where Blizzard\\'s greed starts to shine through. They get $1 for every successful Real-money auction. So there\\'s no incentive for them to fix their broken game experience. They\\'ll just sit back and watch desperate people trying to squeeze an ounce of fun out of their game by spending their real income on virtual garbage. Did a champion pack with aggravating affixes just demolish you repeatedly? Why not spend 5 bucks on this amulet to improve your chances?<br /><br />Then there\\'s the fact that the real-money auction earnings either dump directly into a blizzard balance that you have to spend in their digital store, or you can transfer it through paypal to your account. Paypal takes their cut, and I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Blizzard owns some part ofPaypal through subsidiaries.<br /><br />Soon, even the in-game currency will be available for purchase through their real-money auction house. They couldn\\'t figure out how to make a game that the Chinese wouldn\\'t farm and sell virtual goods in, so they just embraced it, and now they\\'re going to get their cut at least.<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor, go play something else.

              " (\"It works as a labeler, but is one of the most frustrating pieces of equipment to use. First, there's no number row. So any time you want to put numbers in your labels, you must toggle a modifier key first. Even worse, all of the punctuation is buried behind the format or insert menus. I'm sure at some point I could get used to where they are all hidden, but why? Similarly, all of the layout options (two line printing, italics, etc.) are also uncovered by working around in those menus. It takes several times more time to work out a label (anything more than simple alphabet characters) than it really should, and longer than it does with other label makers.    The worst part has been the labels themselves. The white paper (non-laminated) labels it comes with have yet to stick for an extended period (a few weeks). Every single one of them, no matter the surface placed on (wood, laminate, plastic, metal), has started to peel up. Due to the low price, I got some of the other label types and so far the laminated ones seem to actually stick. The peeling labels wouldn't be nearly so infuriating if it wasn't so dang difficult to re-print them (when they have any formatting).    This would probably be a good labeler for someone who wants to make simple labels like a name. If you want to make anything more complex, there are far better options that are far more user-friendly. And the labels, at least the ones I've used, do not have any staying power. I am so far very disappointed in the experience of typing a label and the longevity of the labels themselves.    ***UPDATE***     So after a few more weeks, I can say that I'm still not impressed. The glossy laminated labels seem to be adhering better, but they still don't stick as well as I was expecting. The paper labels are essentially useless. I've found that the less you handle the back, the better, but this is easier said than done. You have to touch the back at least a little to line things up.    The symbols available are fairly extensive, but it's a real pain in the ass to build a simple label with multiple symbols (including basic punctuation!) because you have to go back into the insert menu, go up and down the list of symbols until you find the one you want, and then can select it. Entering the same symbol over and over again is easy, the menu at least remembers where you are. For example, it took about a dozen key presses to find the ohm symbol. Not the end of the world, that's fairly specific. But then to add the dash (to indicate a range) took another eight or ten presses, then another eight or ten to get back to the ohm symbol. Seems way more hard than it needs to be, particularly for common punctuation (period, comma, et. al.).     Finally, the two line mode really, really stinks. It's difficult to select the line. There is no enter key to just make a new line, so you have to go into the menus, remembering if it's insert or format or settings. And then it prints out all squished. Single lines print out professional looking, but the two line look like the characters have been stretched about 30%. You cannot use the double and the single line labels together and expect an even remotely cohesive look.\",\n",

However, I think that is much of the point of these offbeat movies made for the SyFy Network.  You could easily make an argument that for investment purposes, this may be one of the best movies ever.  Made for $1 million, it\\'s a big hit.  So here\\'s the deal.<br /><br />Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering) is a former surfing champ who now owns a bar on the beach near L. A.  As a hurricane brews off the Mexican coast, strong winds move up the California shoreline.  Water spouts begin to appear at the same time as a large school of sharks.  Before you know it, the large water spouts pick up the sharks and start depositing them inland.  At the same time the tropical storm is flooding everything.  This give the re-deposited sharks access to the storm drains as well as an occasional swimming pool.<br /><br />Fin along with an Australian surfing buddy Baz (Jaason Simmons), George (John Heard), the local drunk and a hot employee named Nova (Cassie Scerbo) head for the hills (literally) to look in on Fin\\'s ex-wife, April (a stone faced Tara Reid), his teenage daughter, Claudia (Aubrey Peeples) and college aged son, Matt (Chuck Hittinger).  Well Matt\\'s away at flight school or something, April and Claudia insist they don\\'t need help.  That is until a flying shark eats April\\'s new boyfriend.<br /><br />So most of the movie has sharks appearing from everywhere eating everything and everyone in their path.  Fin and company concoct a plan to have flyboy Matt and Nova take a helicopter up into the now 3 tornados and toss in an improvised bomb which will defuse the tornado and kill the sharks contained therein.  And guess what?  It works.  One casualty is Nova when she is taken off guard and swallowed by a flying great white shark.<br /><br />Although for most of the movie, I thought Nova was going to be Fin\\'s girlfriend, it turns out she\\'s better suited for son Matt.  That way Fin can reunite with April.  But wait, Nova was swallowed by the great white.  No matter.  Fin armed with a chain saw, manages to find the same fish and dive in head first, cutting his way out from the inside and saving Nova for Matt.  I have to admit to laughing out loud for much of the film.  I was especially caught up in several lines uttered that came verbatim from \"Jaws.\"  Like I said, this may be the worst or best movie ever.',\n",

I can remove the clip, but I\\'d prefer my headset not be on the verge of falling to the ground.<br /><br />The on/off switch is small and rigid, but is easy enough to manipulate. The volume button is a single rocker type, but is small enough to be difficult to manipulate consistently.<br /><br />Sound from incoming voice is impressive and I have heard no complaints from the people I\\'ve called about the quality of the signal they receive. Though the HK250 is capable of streaming media audio, I\\'m not impressed by its music acoustic qualities; the feature ranks as mere gimmick on monaural devices, though I applaud the Bluetooth specification which enables it since, being a speaker it may as well play back media audio - it\\'s convenient.<br /><br />My favorite thing about the HK250 is the spoken audible cues; connection status, battery level, the phone number of the incoming calls and a subtle \"double-blip\" which indicates when the call recipient picks up the line.<br /><br />The finish is unappealing. I thought there was a thin, transparent piece of protective plastic to peel off the surface, but there\\'s not. The plastic face readily shows finger smudges.<br /><br />Overall, this is fine for smaller ears. It has exceptional voice quality for an earpiece at its price. It can pair up with multiple devices at the same time. The range is exceptional; the connection remains through several walls, from one side of the house to the backyard at the other end. I can use the charger from another brand of earpiece [the connector that looks like a mini HDMI plug] to charge the HK250 as well.',\n",

You also cannot connect the camera to the computer to view files, you must remove the SD card and put that into your computer each time. Also, on the installation disk included, the camera model (DVR 781 HD) is not even included in the selections which tells you something. Tested the camera a few times, it worked fine but a decent camera today can shoot better. Also, navigating the menus inside the camera is a hassle and only through constant practice will you be able to understand that, within the menus, the shutter butter is enter and the OK button is back.

Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.',\n",

In looking at the table of contents here on Amazon, I liked that it seemed to address the standards, etc.<br /><br />But I am disappointed...<br />1 - Over and over, the 'activities' are repetitive games or cutesy activities rather than actual learning activities.  The only things that seem to change are the props - fake spiders., flies, frogs, etc.  The game idea is repetitive ('short path game', 'long path game', etc. Essentially for too many activities, little changes other than the props and what's on the laminated board.,<br />2 - The directions are vague and non-directive.  This is a critical problem since seasoned teachers should be able to quickly skim to find activities to find salient data - 'close reading' only when material deserves it (i.e., is worth the time). &#34;Descriptions&#34; meander rather than state the important stuff up front.  &#34;Materials&#34; are written as a narrative (vs. concisely)  Critical information (such as failing to include 'go on a field trip' in &#34;Pumpkin Growing Prediction chart&#34; (no seeds or seed growing is included ... how can kids predict growth without actually seeing it?)<br />3 - 'Mathematics Content Standards Connection' - fails to list the SPECIFIC standard being addressed- and the ones listed in the beginning are NOT the ones that Kindergartens across the nation use. (&#34;... This activity aligns to the Data Analysis and Probability Standard because children are organizing data...&#34;) (but they're not, since the &#34;materials&#34; for activity doesn't include this)<br />4 - While this would be something the well equipped classroom (with all the fake animals, etc., needed for activities) could use, most classroom teachers don't have ready access to fake frogs, flies, spiders, dogs, etc.<br />5 - Over and over the authors write (after 'MODIFICATIONS FOR SPECIAL NEEDS OR SITUATIONS') &#34;No special modifications are needed... 'No modifications are anticipated ... This activity is accessible to all children... HA! Then WHY ARE THESE KIDS CONSIDERED 'SPECIAL NEEDS'? The authors have not seriously taken into consideration the needs of kids with all manner of disabilities - to repeatedly say no modifications are needed is to ignore the reality that kids like mine won't learn effectively when given instruction like this.  At the very least, these should have been reviewed by special ed teachers re: accuracy.<br /><br />All in all, I am dearly disappointed in the lack of actual teaching instruction other that cutesy activities.<br /><br />A better mathematics choice?

He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It\\'s exciting reading and can be found on Kindle\\'s list.',\n",

However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective.\",\n",

I purchased this based on the item description, which says that it works with all major cell phone companies in the US, with some listed exceptions. T-Mobile is a major cell phone company, and its network is not one of the exceptions listed. I installed it in my attic, powered it up, then spent a LONG time trying to figure out why it had no effect at all on my phone's reception. Turns out T-Mobile 4G is on a different bandwidth, though you have no way of knowing that from the description of the product on Amazon's site. (T-Mobile's 2G does work with this product.) I purchased from ANTOnline (there are different sellers for this product, depending on when you happen to buy). ANTOnline refused to give me a return RMA until Amazon intervened, and even then they took out a 15% restocking fee, which was just theft. In the process of figuring out how this technology works I talked to T-Mobile, and they sent me a free booster that actually works with their 4G network. Having tried both (Wilson's on the 2G, TMobile's on 4G) I have to conclude that Wilson's technology is falling behind: T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install.

Of course, there are optional applications that came with a disc. Activation code is labeled on the computer. Everything works out fine. All the driver updates and applications that are necessary for your hard drive took about 10% of storage, something that I found some people do complain about. But nothing useless is found, unlike majority of pc on the market. Now as for gaming. It does allow you to run majority of games that are available. However, keep that in mind, lots of games have low requirements, so this hardware works just fine. I use mmohut as reference, but a lot game review sites have similar rating on games. For their top rate games, this computer is nothing to brag about. Many popular games have way too high requirement that is just out of this computer's league. It does allow me to play certain game like Soul of Ultimate Nation at high setting very smooth. For a casual gamer, less intensive applications, and for $500, this computer is truly a steal. But if you want to run heavy intensive games like WoW, Terra, and so on; you can settle for low setting or do some serious upgrades. My new parts are arriving soon, so I will update as soon as I can.<br /><br />Update: I bought AMD Radeon HD 7850 ($210) to replace the graphic card that came with the machine. Now this is truly a gaming computer. Everything is above 7.0 in Windows Index except hard drive. The new graphic card makes the machine runs extremely quiet, unlike before which felt a trunk driving by every single time it is turned on. Although I did upgrade the memory ram to 16GB, which I don't think it's really necessary for everyone. My advice to everyone that want to play some of the popular game today, upgrade to a better graphic card. Another thing I notice is that my computer's motherboard is GA-78LMT-S2, while current product description is ASRock 960GM-GS3 FX. They probably changed to the newer one.<br /><br />My rating still remains. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do want to run the games I like in medium to high settings smoothly. This is also my first time to purchase a built PC and have upgrade it myself. I'm ok with what it is, and can be upgraded quite easily.\",\n",
